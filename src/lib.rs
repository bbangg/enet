//!
//! # Features and Architecture
//!
//! ENet evolved specifically as a UDP networking layer for the multiplayer first person shooter
//! Cube.
//!
//! Cube necessitated low latency communication with data sent out very frequently, so TCP was an
//! unsuitable choice due to its high latency and stream orientation. UDP, however, lacks many
//! sometimes necessary features from TCP such as reliability, sequencing, unrestricted packet
//! sizes, and connection management. So UDP by itself was not suitable as a network protocol
//! either. No suitable freely available networking libraries existed at the time of ENet's creation
//! to fill this niche.
//!
//! UDP and TCP could have been used together in Cube to benefit somewhat from both of their
//! features, however, the resulting combinations of protocols still leaves much to be desired.
//! TCP lacks multiple streams of communication without resorting to opening many sockets and
//! complicates delineation of packets due to its buffering behavior. UDP lacks sequencing,
//! connection management, management of bandwidth resources, and imposes limitations on the size of
//! packets. A significant investment is required to integrate these two protocols, and the end
//! result is worse off in features and performance than the uniform protocol presented by ENet.
//!
//! ENet thus attempts to address these issues and provide a single, uniform protocol layered over
//! UDP to the developer with the best features of UDP and TCP as well as some useful features
//! neither provide, with a much cleaner integration than any resulting from a mixture of UDP and
//! TCP.
//!
//! ## Connection Management
//!
//! ENet provides a simple connection interface over which to communicate with a foreign host. The
//! liveness of the connection is actively monitored by pinging the foreign host at frequent
//! intervals, and also monitors the network conditions from the local host to the foreign host such
//! as the mean round trip time and packet loss in this fashion.
//!
//! ## Sequencing
//!
//! Rather than a single byte stream that complicates the delineation of packets, ENet presents
//! connections as multiple, properly sequenced packet streams that simplify the transfer of various
//! types of data.
//!
//! ENet provides sequencing for all packets by assigning to each sent packet a sequence number that
//! is incremented as packets are sent. ENet guarantees that no packet with a higher sequence number
//! will be delivered before a packet with a lower sequence number, thus ensuring packets are
//! delivered exactly in the order they are sent.
//!
//! For unreliable packets, ENet will simply discard the lower sequence number packet if a packet
//! with a higher sequence number has already been delivered. This allows the packets to be
//! dispatched immediately as they arrive, and reduce latency of unreliable packets to an absolute
//! minimum. For reliable packets, if a higher sequence number packet arrives, but the preceding
//! packets in the sequence have not yet arrived, ENet will stall delivery of the higher sequence
//! number packets until its predecessors have arrived.
//!
//! ## Channels
//!
//! Since ENet will stall delivery of reliable packets to ensure proper sequencing, and consequently
//! any packets of higher sequence number whether reliable or unreliable, in the event the reliable
//! packet's predecessors have not yet arrived, this can introduce latency into the delivery of
//! other packets which may not need to be as strictly ordered with respect to the packet that
//! stalled their delivery.
//!
//! To combat this latency and reduce the ordering restrictions on packets, ENet provides multiple
//! channels of communication over a given connection. Each channel is independently sequenced, and
//! so the delivery status of a packet in one channel will not stall the delivery of other packets
//! in another channel.
//!
//! ## Reliability
//!
//! ENet provides optional reliability of packet delivery by ensuring the foreign host acknowledges
//! receipt of all reliable packets. ENet will attempt to resend the packet up to a reasonable
//! amount of times, if no acknowledgement of the packet's receipt happens within a specified
//! timeout. Retry timeouts are progressive and become more lenient with every failed attempt to
//! allow for temporary turbulence in network conditions.
//!
//! ## Fragmentation and Reassembly
//!
//! ENet will send and deliver packets regardless of size. Large packets are fragmented into many
//! smaller packets of suitable size, and reassembled on the foreign host to recover the original
//! packet for delivery. The process is entirely transparent to the developer.
//!
//! ## Aggregation
//!
//! ENet aggregates all protocol commands, including acknowledgements and packet transfer, into
//! larger protocol packets to ensure the proper utilization of the connection and to limit the
//! opportunities for packet loss that might otherwise result in further delivery latency.
//!
//! ## Adaptability
//!
//! ENet provides an in-flight data window for reliable packets to ensure connections are not
//! overwhelmed by volumes of packets. It also provides a static bandwidth allocation mechanism to
//! ensure the total volume of packets sent and received to a host don't exceed the host's
//! capabilities. Further, ENet also provides a dynamic throttle that responds to deviations from
//! normal network connections to rectify various types of network congestion by further limiting
//! the volume of packets sent.
